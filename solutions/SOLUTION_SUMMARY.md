## Import Considerations

### Prerequisites for Target Environment

1. **Environment Requirements**
   - Active Dataverse database
   - Power Platform license
   - Minimum version: 9.2.x or higher

2. **User Permissions**
   - System Administrator role, OR
   - System Customizer role

3. **Environment Health**
   - Environment should be in healthy state
   - No ongoing critical issues
   - Sufficient storage available

### Known Limitations

- **Baseline Solution**: This is v1.0.0.1 (baseline) with no functional components yet
- **Unmanaged Type**: This is an unmanaged solution, suitable for development/test
- **No Dependencies**: Solution has no external dependencies (simplifies import)

### Import Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Version conflict | Low | This is first version, no conflicts expected |
| Permission issues | Low | Documented required permissions |
| Environment capacity | Very Low | Solution is minimal size (~1.7 KB) |
| Breaking changes | None | Baseline solution, no existing functionality |

**Overall Risk Level**: **Very Low**

## Recommendations

### For Initial Import (Development)

1. âœ… Import into development environment first
2. âœ… Validate solution presence and structure
3. âœ… Document import experience
4. âœ… Use as baseline for future component additions

### For Test Environment Import

1. Import after successful development import
2. Validate publisher configuration
3. Test component addition workflow
4. Document any environment-specific issues

### For Production Import (Future)

1. **DO NOT** import this baseline version to production yet
2. Wait for version with functional components
3. Follow full change management process
4. Consider managed solution for production

### Next Steps

1. âœ… **Immediate**: Import solution to development environment
2. âœ… **Short-term**: Begin adding Dataverse metadata components
3. ðŸ“‹ **Medium-term**: Increment version to 1.1.0.0 with new components
4. ðŸ“‹ **Long-term**: Plan managed solution strategy for production
