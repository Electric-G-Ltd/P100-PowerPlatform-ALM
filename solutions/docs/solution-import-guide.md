3. Verify you're in the correct environment

### Step 2: Import the Solution

1. In the left navigation, click **Solutions**
2. Click **Import solution** in the command bar
3. Click **Browse** and select the solution ZIP file:
   - `P100ElectricalAgentSuite_1_0_0_1.zip`
4. Click **Next**

### Step 3: Solution Information Review

1. Review the solution details:
   - **Name**: P100 Electrical Agent Suite
   - **Version**: 1.0.0.1
   - **Publisher**: Beren
2. Click **Next**

### Step 4: Configure Import Options

1. **Advanced Settings** (optional):
   - Enable plug-ins and workflows: **Yes** (when applicable)
   - Activate SDK messages: **Yes** (when applicable)
   - For baseline solution (v1.0.0.1), default settings are appropriate

2. Click **Import** to begin the import process

### Step 5: Monitor Import Progress

1. The import job will begin processing
2. Monitor the progress indicator
3. Wait for completion (typically 1-5 minutes for baseline solution)

### Step 6: Verify Import Success

1. Once import completes, review the import summary:
   - **Status**: Should show "Success"
   - **Warnings**: Review any warnings (if present)
   - **Errors**: Address any errors immediately

2. Click on the solution name to open it
3. Verify all expected components are present

---

## Post-Import Validation

### Validation Steps

1. **Solution Presence**
   ```
   Navigate to: Solutions → P100 Electrical Agent Suite
   Verify: Solution appears in the list
   Verify: Version shows 1.0.0.1
   ```

2. **Publisher Validation**
   ```
   Navigate to: Settings → Customizations → Publishers
   Verify: "Beren" publisher exists
   Verify: Prefix is "luthien"
   ```

3. **Component Count**
   - For v1.0.0.1 (baseline): 0 components expected (empty solution)
   - For future versions: Verify expected component count

4. **Environment Health Check**
   ```
   Navigate to: Settings → Solutions → Solution Checker
   Run solution checker: Select P100 Electrical Agent Suite
   Review results: Address any critical or high severity issues
   ```

## Import Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Import (New Environment)

- Import type: **New installation**
- Expected duration: 1-2 minutes
- Risk level: **Low**
- Rollback: Simply delete the solution if needed

### Scenario 2: Upgrade (Existing Solution)

- Import type: **Upgrade**
- Expected duration: 2-5 minutes
- Risk level: **Medium**
- Rollback: Restore from backup or export current version first

### Scenario 3: Production Import

- Import type: Varies
- Expected duration: 5-10 minutes
- Risk level: **High**
- Rollback: Requires backup restoration
- **Best Practice**: Always test in UAT first

## Common Import Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Missing Dependencies

**Symptom**: Import fails with dependency errors

**Resolution**:
1. Check if dependent solutions need to be imported first
2. Verify all required publishers exist in the target environment
3. Import dependencies before the main solution

### Issue 2: Insufficient Privileges

**Symptom**: "You do not have permission to import solutions"

**Resolution**:
1. Verify your security role (must be System Admin or System Customizer)
2. Contact your Power Platform administrator
3. Request appropriate permissions

### Issue 3: Version Conflict

**Symptom**: "The solution version is lower than the existing version"

**Resolution**:
1. If this is intentional, delete the existing solution first
2. Otherwise, increment the version number and re-package
3. Export current solution as backup before deletion

### Issue 4: Import Takes Too Long

**Symptom**: Import process exceeds expected duration

**Resolution**:
1. Check environment health in Power Platform Admin Center
2. Verify no other heavy operations are running
3. Cancel and retry during off-peak hours if needed

### Issue 5: Managed vs Unmanaged Conflict

**Symptom**: Cannot overwrite managed solution with unmanaged

**Resolution**:
1. Uninstall managed solution first (if safe to do so)
2. Or package as managed solution if target requires it
3. Contact admin if unsure about solution type strategy

## Import Logging

### Create an Import Log

After each import, document the following in `/solutions/import-logs/`:

**Log Template**: `import-log-YYYY-MM-DD-v[VERSION].md`

```markdown
# Import Log - P100 Electrical Agent Suite

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Version**: 1.0.0.1
**Environment**: [Development/Test/Production]
**Environment URL**: [URL]
**Imported By**: [Your Name]

## Import Summary

- **Status**: [Success/Failed/Success with Warnings]
- **Duration**: [X minutes]
- **Warnings**: [List any warnings]
- **Errors**: [List any errors]

## Components Imported

- [List of components or "None - baseline solution"]

## Validation Results

- [ ] Solution appears in solution list
- [ ] Version number is correct
- [ ] Publisher is correct
- [ ] All expected components present

## Rollback Procedures

If import causes issues:

### For Non-Production Environments

1. Navigate to Solutions
2. Select P100 Electrical Agent Suite
3. Click **Delete** in the command bar
4. Confirm deletion
5. Re-import previous version if needed

### For Production Environments

1. **Do NOT delete** without approval
2. Contact system administrator immediately
3. Prepare environment backup restoration if needed
4. Document all issues before taking action
5. Follow change management procedures

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always test in lower environments first** (Dev → Test → UAT → Production)
2. **Take backups** before importing into production
3. **Import during maintenance windows** for production
4. **Document everything** in import logs
5. **Use Solution Checker** before and after import
6. **Version control** - never decrease version numbers
7. **Communicate** with stakeholders about imports
8. **Monitor** environment performance after import

---

## Success Criteria

Import is considered successful when:

- ✅ Import status shows "Success"
- ✅ No critical or high-severity errors
- ✅ Solution appears in solution list with correct version
- ✅ All expected components are present and functional
- ✅ No degradation in environment performance
- ✅ Solution Checker shows no new critical issues
- ✅ Import log is completed and filed

---

## Next Steps After Successful Import

1. Complete the import log
2. Run post-import validation tests
3. Update solution documentation
4. Notify stakeholders of completion
5. Plan next iteration or enhancement
