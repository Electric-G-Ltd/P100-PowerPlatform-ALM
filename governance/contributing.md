## Quick Start

### 1. Understand the One-Topic-At-A-Time Workflow

At any given time, **only one topic is active**. Check the repository for the issue labeled `topic:active`.

If you want to start new work:
- Verify the current active topic is complete
- Request approval from @electricgltd to mark the new topic as `topic:active`
- Begin work once approved

### 2. Create an Issue

**Naming Convention:** `25P###-Title-In-Kebab-Case`

**Example:** `25P002-Database-Migration`

**Components:**
- `25` = Year (2025)
- `P` = Project prefix
- `###` = Sequential number (increment from the last issue)
- `Title` = Descriptive title, kebab-case

**Issue Template:**
Use the standardized issue template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/copilot-task.yml`). Include:
- Clear description of work
- Acceptance criteria
- Teach-Back section (explain the professional reasoning and what will be learned)
