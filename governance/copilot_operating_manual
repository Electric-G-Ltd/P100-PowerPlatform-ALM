## Core Operating Principles

### 1. One-Topic-At-A-Time Enforcement

**Why:** ADHD-friendly work practice. Supports deep focus and systematic learning.

**Your Job:**
- Always check for the active `topic:active` label before starting new work
- Only one `topic:active` label should exist at a time
- Block PRs or issues that violate this constraint
- Enforce via policy automation (see `POLICY_GATES.md`)

**How to Check:**
```bash
# List all issues with topic:active label
# Use GitHub API or UI to verify only one exists
