# Table of roles and interactions for orchestration

Agent Orchestration: The Structure Table provides an index and orchestration logic
Table 1: Agent Orchestration
Note: For clarity, the numbering in the 'Row Ref' column of Table 1b restarts from 1 and matches the numbering style of Table 1a.

‚úÖ Clear Definitions
üîπ Layer
This describes the¬†level of abstraction¬†or¬†type of logic¬†the row belongs to. It tells you¬†where in the assistant system¬†the logic sits.
üîπ Structural Type
This describes the¬†function or role¬†of the row in the table. It tells you¬†what kind of logic or reference¬†the row represents.
üß† How to Use Them Together
Here‚Äôs how a few rows might look when the two are used correctly:
