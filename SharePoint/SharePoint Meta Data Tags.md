# SharePoint Mega Data Tags

WüóÇÔ∏è Term Store ‚Äì 25Q4 P100 Copilot Electrical Agent Suite
Term Group: 25Q4 P100 Copilot Electrical Agent Suite
üß© Site Columns & Content Types
Managed Metadata Site Columns (bind each to the Term Set above)
Content Types
Using site columns + content types keeps tags consistent and indexable across libraries; reindex libraries after adding columns to speed up discovery. [(October 3...gent Suite], [Microsoft...umentation]
üóÉÔ∏è Libraries & Folder Defaults (proposed on your site)
Site: https://electricgcouk.sharepoint.com/sites/25Q4P100CopilotElectricalAgentSuite2 (you can adjust names; these are intentionally pragmatic)
Why this structure
Keeps IL/OL/AL obvious via the library context (and folder defaults), while allowing Structural Type to vary per file.
Works well with SharePoint knowledge paths in Copilot (add up to four paths per agent and scope to specific libraries/folders for quality). [(October 3...gent Suite], [Week One o...tHub World]
üè∑Ô∏è Tagging Examples (your current files mapped to the structure)
Use this as a working guide while you organize. Adjust library names if you prefer‚Äîyour tags remain the same.
After moving/retagging, Reindex each library once so the new properties are quickly discoverable by search and Copilot. [(October 3...gent Suite]
‚òëÔ∏è Operational rules (copy into your Word guide)
Always set Layer (IL, OL, AL). It should be required. [Enabling b...SharePoint]
Set Structural Type per file (AG/REF/PRO/PSD/WF). Don‚Äôt default this at folder level except for Standards (AL) where PSD is common. [Enabling b...SharePoint]
Use folder defaults to pre-fill Layer (e.g., libraries/folders dedicated to IL/OL/AL). [(October 3...gent Suite]
Keep Knowledge Type and Agent Priority optional but consistent. Mark ‚Äúmust-use‚Äù guidance as Critical. [(October 3...gent Suite]
Enable Enterprise Keywords in each library during discovery; later, promote popular keywords into the Term Store. [(October 3...gent Suite]
When you add or change columns, Reindex the library to refresh search. [(October 3...gent Suite]
In Copilot Studio, scope knowledge to the specific libraries/folders above (avoid whole-site paths) and add at most four paths per agent; optionally upload key explainers as file knowledge. [Week One o...tHub World]
