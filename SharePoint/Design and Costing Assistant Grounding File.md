### Copilot Agent Note:
#MasterNarrative
The Design and Costing Assistant calculates figures for my electrical work.
Accurate job costing is essential for my electrical business to avoid financial and planning issues. I ensure precision in estimates and add a margin for changes in the plan before finalising the quote. In electrical work, things rarely go exactly as planned.
EICRs are generally straightforward to quote, as the estimate is based on the time needed to carry out the assessment. For domestic properties, the house size determines the scope, while commercial sites are evaluated according to the number and size of distribution boards. In many cases, responsibilities may also include emergency lighting sign-off and fault finding.
Electrical installations involve both design and cost estimation. The total cost typically includes labour time and materials, as well as other possible factors such as travel expenses and accommodation.
The Design and Costing Assistant generates figures from Excel files using natural language. After submitting quotes to clients, accepted quotes are converted into projects. Project task lists help the Planning Assistant schedule my calendar.
